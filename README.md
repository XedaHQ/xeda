**Xeda** `/ˈziːdə/` is a cross-platform, cross-EDA, cross-target simulation and synthesis automation platform.
It assists hardware developers in verification, evaluation, and deployment of RTL designs. Xeda supports flows from multiple commercial and open-source electronic design automation suites.

**Xeda is the one tool to rule 'em all!**

For further details, visit the [Xeda's documentations](http://xeda.rtfd.io/) (Work In Progress).

## Installation

Python 3.9 or newer is required. To install the latest published version from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/xeda) run:

```
python3 -m pip install -U xeda
```

### Development

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/XedaHQ/xeda.git
cd xeda
python3 -m pip install -U --editable . --config-settings editable_mode=strict
```

## Usage

Run `xeda --help` to see a list of available commands and options.

### Design Description

Xeda design-specific descriptions and settings are organized through project files specified in [TOML](https://toml.io/). Every project contains one or more HDL designs. The default name for the project file is `xedaproject.toml`.

Sample Xeda design description [file](./examples/vhdl/sqrt/sqrt.toml):

```toml
name = "sqrt"
description = "Iterative computation of square-root of an integer"
language.vhdl.standard = "2008"

[rtl]
sources = ["sqrt.vhdl"]
top = "sqrt"
clock_port = "clk"
parameters = { G_IN_WIDTH = 32 }
# parameters = { G_IN_WIDTH = 32, G_ITERATIVE = true, G_STR= "abcd", G_BITVECTOR="7'b0101001" }

[tb]
sources = ["tb_sqrt.py"]
cocotb = true
# top = "tb_sqrt"  # FIXME

[flows.vivado_synth]
fpga.part = 'xc7a12tcsg325-1'
clock_period = 5.0
```

## Flows

A `Tool` is an abstraction for an executable which is responsible for one or several steps in an EDA flow. A `Tool` can be executed as a native binary already installed on the system, in a virtualized container (e.g. `docker`), or on a remote system.
A `Flow` is a collection of steps performed by one or several tools. A Xeda `Flow` implements the following methods:

- `init`(optional): initializations which need to happen after  the instantiation of a `Flow` instance. At this stage, the flow can specify and customize dependency flows, which will be run before execution of the flow. Seperation of this stage form Python `__init__` enables greater flexibility and more effective control over the execution of flows.
- `run`: main execution of the flow which includes generation of files, scripts, and tool arguments as well as execution of one or several tools. All dependencies have been already executed before `run` begins, and the completed dependencies (and their results and artifacts) will be available.
- `parse_results`(optional): evaluate and interpret generated reports or other artifacts.
