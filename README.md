**Xeda** `/ˈziːdə/` is a cross-platform, cross-EDA, cross-target simulation and synthesis automation platform.
It assists hardware developers in verification, evaluation, and deployment of RTL designs. Xeda supports flows from multiple commercial and open-source electronic design automation suites.

**Xeda is the one tool to rule 'em all!**

For further details, visit the [Xeda's documentations](http://xeda.rtfd.io/) (Work In Progress).




## Installation
Python 3.8 or newer is required. To install the latest published version from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/xeda) run:
```
python3 -m pip install -U xeda
```

### Development
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/XedaHQ/xeda.git
cd xeda
python3 -m pip install -U -e .
```

## Usage
Run `xeda --help` to see a list of available commands and options.


### Design Description

Xeda design-specific descriptions and settings are organized through project files specified in [TOML](https://toml.io/). Every project contains one or more HDL designs. The default name for the project file is `xedaproject.toml`.

Sample Xeda design description [file](./examples/vhdl/sqrt/sqrt.toml):

```toml
name = 'sqrt'
description = 'Integer Square Root'
language.vhdl.standard = "2008"

[rtl]
sources = ['sqrt.vhdl']
top = 'sqrt'
clock_port = 'clk'
parameters = { G_IN_WIDTH = 32 }
# parameters = { G_IN_WIDTH = 32, G_ITERATIVE = true, G_STR= "abcd", G_BITVECTOR="7'b0101001" }

[tb]
sources = ['tb/tb_sqrt.py']
cocotb = true
top = 'tb_sqrt'
```

## Flows
A `Tool` is an abstraction for an executable which is responsible for one or several steps in an EDA flow. A `Tool` can be executed as a native binary already installed on the system, in a virtualized container (e.g. `docker`), or on a remote system.
A `Flow` is a collection of steps performed by one or several tools. A Xeda `Flow` implements the following methods:
- `init`(optional): initializations which need to happen after  the instantiation of a `Flow` instance. At this stage, the flow can specify and customize dependency flows, which will be run before execution of the flow. Seperation of this stage form Python `__init__` enables greater flexibility and more effective control over the execution of flows.
- `run`: main execution of the flow which includes generation of files, scripts, and tool arguments as well as execution of one or several tools. All dependencies have been already executed before `run` begins, and the completed dependencies (and their results and artifacts) will be available.
- `parse_results`(optional): evaluate and interpret generated reports or other artifacts.
